# odinProject---ETCH-A-SKETCH

This is project in Odin Project curiculum.

It's project in which user creates grid made from squares. The user can draw in this grid.

What have I learned in this project:
    - function changeColorVar(e){
    switch(e.target.dataset.color){...}}
    + buttonColor.forEach(button => button.addEventListener('click', changeColorVar))
    --> event + event.target - this is valuable, it helped me a lot.
    
    - while loops can be usefull aswell, dont try to solve everything with forloop
-foreach
-x.style.xxxx - css through JS
-css: display -grid; height,width
